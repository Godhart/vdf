# Done

- [x] Specification draft
- [x] Minimal specification core implementation
  <br> Core implements basic mechanics defined by specification and provides easy way to extend it further
- [x] Minimal language support for description - combo of Markdown + VHDL
- [x] Running VHDL code (at proof-of-concept stage)
- [x] Running interactively via Jupyter Notebook
- [x] Basic run results representation in Jupyter
  - [x] showing created sources
  - [x] waveforms display for HDL runs

# You Are Here

(things below will be ready really soon or were just done)

- [ ] Ways to run
  - [ ] locally on host (determine minimum suitable versions of packages)
  - [ ] in docker
  - [ ] in cloud

# To Be Done soon

- [ ] Basic run results representation in Markdown
  - [ ] showing created sources
  - [ ] waveforms display for HDL runs
- [ ] Verilog support
- [ ] Contribution description and other community-related general things
- [ ] Ad-hoc expressions evaluation
- [ ] Off-source stimulus generation for HDL runs

# A few moments later

- [ ] Complex HDL support
- [ ] Reverse VDF description (in the source)
- [ ] Mechanics for 3rd parties extensions
- [ ] Schematics from YAML

# So far the future is cloudy

Following depends on community launch
