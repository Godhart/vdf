# Done

- [x] Specification draft
- [x] Minimal specification core implementation
  <br> Core implements basic mechanics defined by specification and provides easy way to extend it further
- [x] Minimal language support for description - combo of Markdown + VHDL
- [x] Running VHDL code (at proof-of-concept stage)

# You Are Here

(things below will be ready really soon)

- [ ] Running interactively via Jupyter Notebook with
  - ad-hoc expressions evaluation
- [ ] Basic run results representation with
  - showing created sources
  - showing expressions results

# To Be Done soon

- [ ] Stimulus generation for HDL runs
- [ ] Waveforms display for HDL runs
- [ ] Verilog support
- [ ] Contribution description and other community-related general things
- [ ] Ways to run
  - locally on host
  - in docker
  - in cloud

# A few moments later

- [ ] Complex HDL support
- [ ] Reverse VDF description (in the source)
- [ ] Mechanics for 3rd parties extensions
- [ ] Schematics from YAML

# So far future is cloudy

Following depends on community launch
